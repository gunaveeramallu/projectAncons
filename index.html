ANCONS brings to you a 4 month intensive training program to become a 'Blockchain Engineering' starting every year in January, May and September.</p>

<p class="subHead text">

Blockchain is a revolution that is disrupting all sectors of the economy, decentralizing applications for a better world. It is 'the technology' that you, young engineers, should grab this opportunity and get trained on all the aspects of this wonderful technology. It is the future technology and so you have a FUTURE to look upon. 
<p class="subHead text">
Be a part of this revolutionary technology by enrolling into the intensive program.  Upon successful completion of the program, you will be awarded over a 'Certificate' which will enable you to become a 'Blockchain Engineer'. It is anticipated that there will be a shortage of 'blockchain Engineers' as there is a huge creation of blockchain companies.

            <p class="mainHead headCenter">What is Blockchain Technology?</p>
            <p class="subHead text">
                    Blockchain is a term that has to come to mean many things to many people. For developers, it is a set of protocols and encryption technology for securely storing data on a distributed network. For business and finance, it is a distributed ledger and the technology underlying the explosion of new digital currencies. For technologists, it is the driving force behind the next generation of internet. For others, it is a tool for radically reshaping society and economy taking us into a more decentralized world. Whichever way you look at it, blockchain has become a term which captures the imagination and fascinates many. The implications of such technology are truly profound. For the first time in human history, people anywhere can trust each other and transact within large peer to peer networks without centralised managements. Trust is established not by centralised institutions but by protocols, cryptography and computer code. This greatly strengthens our capacity for collaboration and cooperation between organizations and individuals within peer networks enabling us to potential form global networks of collaboration without centralized formal institutions unprecedented but hugely relevant in an age of globalization and a new set of 21st century challenges that require mass collaboration.</p>

            <p class = "mainHead">What to look for in a blockchain program ?</p>
            <p  class="subHead text">The blockchain is much more than a technology.  It is also a culture and a community which is passionate about creating a more equitable world through decentralization.  <br> <br> It is a movement to disrupt the disruptors to redesign the internet and in so doing shake up existing centralized incumbents. Throughout this course, we will introduce you  culture and its aspirations.<br> <br> The program gives you a 360 degree overview to the different dimensions of the technology, its potential applications within various industries and its far reaching implications for society and economy. In the first section of the course, we give an overview of the blockchain both on a technical and non technical level. We will also discuss the blockchain within the context of emerging next generation internet.
                
                In the second section, we will talk about the blockchain as a so called trust machine and how it enables to transparency and collaboration. We will look into distributed ledger technology talking about smart contracts, ethereum and decentralized applications. In the third section, will introduce to the workings of token economies illustration how the blockchain and distributed ledgers work to build platforms in different ecosystems through the use of tokens to incentivize behavior. In the last section of the course, we would be looking at specific applications of the blockchain to economy, society, technology and environment looking at both existing practical applications and potential future applications.</p>

            <p class="mainHead headCenter">Is Blockchain Technology a revolution?</p>
            <p class="subHead text">
                    The blockchain is an emerging technology that is currently experiencing rapid revolution. With in the space of two or three years, it is already gone through changes in its technical implementation and our understanding of what blockchain is and can be. As such, our goal is to make a comprehensive understanding of blockchain within the broader process of of next generation internet. 

<br>
<br>
                    The blockchain was designed that transactions to be immutable meaning that it cannot be deleted. Each block contains a hash value, it is dependent on the hash value of the previous block so that they all link together meaning if one block is changed then all blocks linked to it the other nodes will be altered. This works to make the data entered tamper proof.

            <p class="mainHead">What is within the Blockchain Technology?</p>
            <p class="subHead text">Blockchain is a new class of information technology that combines cryptography with distributed computing both of which existed for a number of decades. It was the genius of Santoshi Nakamotu to combine in new ways to find a model where a network of computers collaborate towards maintaining a secured and shared database. Blockchain is a secured distributed database. This database consists of a string of blocks, each one a record of data that has been encrypted and given a unique identifier called the hash. Mining computers on the network validate transactions, add them to the block they built and broadcast them to the other nodes which have a copy of the database. Because there is no centralized component to verify the alterations to the database, the blockchain depends on the consensus of distributed computer algorithm nodes to make an entry on the blockchain database. All the computers have to agree about its state so no one computer can make an alteration without the consensus of others. Once completed a block goes into the blockchain as a permanent record. Each time a block gets completed, a new one is generated. There is a countless number of blocks in the blockchain all connected to each other like links in a chain in proper linear chronological order.</p>
